Step 1: Given information We are given that proton 1p+2 and antiproton 1p−2 are circulating at equal speeds in opposite directions in the storage ring. Also, we are given that in one of the collisions, p++p−→e++e−+γ+γ , where γ represents high-energy gamma-ray photons. We need to find the speed of proton and antiproton, as a fraction of c, prior to the collision. Step 2: Simplify The energy of each electron and positron is given by the formula E_{e} = \frac{m_{e}c^{2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}} where me​=9.1×10−31kg and c=3×108m/s and v=0.9999995c. Putting the values in the above formula, we get E_{e} = 8.19 \times 10^{ - 11}J Now, the energy of the gamma-ray photon can be calculated as E_{\gamma} = \frac{hc}{\lambda } where λ=1.0×10−6nm and h=6.626×10−34kg⋅m2/s. Putting the values in the above formula, we get E_{\gamma} = 1.9 \times 10^{- 10}J Therefore, the total energy is given by E_{tot} = E_{e} + E_{\gamma } = 2.81 \times 10^{ - 10} J Now, the energy of each proton is given by the formula E_{p} = \frac{m_{p}c^{2}}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v_{p}^{2}}{c^{2}}}} where mp​=1.67×10−27kg. We can use the conservation of energy to find the velocity vp​ of each proton in terms of the total energy Etot​. That is, 2E_{p} + 2\sqrt{(m_{p}c^{2})^{2} + (pc)^{2}} = E_{tot} where p is the momentum of each proton. Solving the above equation for vp​, we get v_{p} = 2.535 \times 10^{8}m/s = \frac{2.535 \times 10^{8}}{3 \times 10^{8}}c=0.845c So, the speed of each proton is 0.845c.
