I want to create a CLI login timeout that is persisteny across program instances using a login log and calculating a delta of the previous five instances to determine if it meets a threshold that warrants attaching a “next viable login timestamp” that the user is compared to on subsequent login attempts. Assume I already have a user table and logins table in SQLite, just give me a verbal overview of how this algorithm should work

Your requirement for a CLI login timeout mechanism with persistence and threshold-based restriction is quite sophisticated. Here's an overview of how the algorithm should work:

1. **Login Attempt Logging**: Every time a user attempts to log in, record the timestamp of this attempt in the logins table. This table should at least contain the user ID, the timestamp of the login attempt, and the success or failure status of the attempt.
    
2. **Threshold Analysis**: On each login attempt, retrieve the timestamps of the previous five attempts for that user from the logins table. Calculate the time deltas between each consecutive attempt. This will give you an array of four time deltas.
    
3. **Threshold Determination**: Define a threshold value, which represents the minimum allowed time between login attempts over a series of five attempts. If the sum of the time deltas is less than this threshold, it indicates that the user has attempted to log in too frequently.
    
4. **Restriction Implementation**: If the threshold condition is met (i.e., the user is attempting logins too frequently), calculate the “next viable login timestamp.” This could be done by taking the timestamp of the fifth attempt and adding a predefined timeout period.
    
5. **Login Attempt Verification**: On subsequent login attempts, first check if the current timestamp is greater than or equal to the “next viable login timestamp” if one exists for that user. If the current time is less, deny the login attempt and inform the user of the next allowed attempt time.
    
6. **Reset Mechanism**: After a successful login or once the timeout period has passed without any login attempts, reset the user's “next viable login timestamp” to allow normal login functionality.
    

This approach ensures that frequent, possibly automated login attempts are restricted, while occasional attempts are unaffected. Remember, this kind of mechanism can also unintentionally lock out legitimate users, so it’s essential to balance security with user experience. Also, consider implementing additional security measures like CAPTCHAs or multi-factor authentication for comprehensive protection.
