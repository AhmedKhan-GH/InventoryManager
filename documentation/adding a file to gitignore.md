Using GitHub Desktop, you can remove a file from your repository on GitHub while keeping it locally, and update your `.gitignore` file. Here's how to do it:

1. **Commit Your Changes**: Before you begin, make sure all your changes are committed. In GitHub Desktop, this can be done from the "Changes" tab on the left side. If you have any uncommitted changes, either commit them or stash them.
    
2. **Open the Repository in Your File Explorer**: In GitHub Desktop, go to `Repository` in the menu bar, and select `Show in Explorer` (Windows) or `Show in Finder` (macOS). This will open the repository in your file explorer.
    
3. **Update `.gitignore`**: Add the file you want to ignore to the `.gitignore` file in your repository. You can open `.gitignore` in a text editor and add the path of the file to it. For example, if you want to ignore a file named `example.txt` in the root directory, you would add `example.txt` to `.gitignore`.
    
4. **Delete the File Locally**: From the file explorer, delete the file that you want to remove from the repository. Don't worry, you'll restore this file later.
    
5. **Commit the Deletion and `.gitignore` Update**: Return to GitHub Desktop. It should now show two changes: the deletion of the file and the modified `.gitignore`. Commit these changes with an appropriate commit message.
    
6. **Restore the File**: Now, go back to your file explorer and restore the file you deleted (you can retrieve it from the Recycle Bin on Windows or the Trash on macOS).
    
7. **Push the Changes to GitHub**: Back in GitHub Desktop, push your changes to the remote repository by clicking the "Push origin" button in the top bar.
    
8. **Ignore the File in Future Commits**: From now on, the file will remain in your local directory but will be ignored in any future commits, thanks to your updated `.gitignore`.
    

By following these steps, you've effectively removed the file from the GitHub repository while keeping it in your local workspace and ensuring it's ignored in future commits.
