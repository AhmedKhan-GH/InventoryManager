  
Building upon the Registration and Access/Login classes, your application will evolve through several layers, each serving specific purposes and building upon the functionalities provided by the previous layers. Here's how you can structure these layers and their respective classes:

1. **Business Logic Layer**: This layer contains classes that implement the core functionalities and rules of your inventory management system. It's where you process data, enforce business rules, and handle complex operations. Classes in this layer would include:
    
    - **Inventory Management**: Handles operations like adding, updating, or deleting inventory items.
    - **Supplier Management**: Manages supplier information and interactions.
    - **Order Processing**: Deals with orders, including placing, tracking, and fulfilling them.
    - **Reporting**: Generates reports like stock levels, sales reports, etc.
    
    These classes will typically use DAOs to interact with the database and may depend on the Registration and Access/Login classes for user-related operations.
    
2. **Runtime Layer**: This layer orchestrates the application's overall flow and manages sessions and states. It might include:
    
    - **Application Controller**: Coordinates the application's operations, directing requests to the appropriate business logic classes.
    - **Session Management**: Handles user sessions, ensuring secure and efficient management of user states throughout their interaction with the application.
    
    The runtime layer builds upon the business logic layer, utilizing its functionalities to execute user commands and operations.
    
3. **Command Line Interface (CLI) Layer**: This is the user interface for console-based interaction. It interprets user commands and communicates with the runtime and business logic layers to execute these commands. Key components include:
    
    - **Command Parser**: Parses and interprets user input, determining what actions to take.
    - **CLI Controllers**: Handle specific command operations, like user registration, login, inventory management, etc., by invoking the appropriate classes in the runtime or business logic layers.
    
    The CLI layer is built on top of the runtime layer, serving as an interface between the user and the application's core functionalities.
    
4. **Graphical User Interface (GUI) Layer**: If you plan to add a GUI (e.g., using wxWidgets), this layer provides a graphical interface for the same functionalities available in the CLI. It includes:
    
    - **UI Controllers**: Similar to CLI controllers but designed for the GUI. They handle events like button clicks, form submissions, etc.
    - **Views**: The actual graphical elements (windows, dialogs, forms) that users interact with.
    
    The GUI layer parallels the CLI layer in functionality but offers a different mode of interaction. It also relies on the runtime and business logic layers to process user actions.
    

In summary, each layer builds upon the capabilities of the previous one:

- The **Business Logic Layer** builds directly upon the foundational Registration and Access/Login classes, implementing specific functionalities of your inventory management system.
- The **Runtime Layer** orchestrates these functionalities and manages the application flow.
- The **CLI and GUI Layers** provide different interfaces for users to interact with the system, utilizing the underlying layers to execute user commands and display results.

This layered architecture ensures separation of concerns, making your application modular, maintainable, and scalable. It also aligns with SOLID principles, promoting a robust and flexible design.
